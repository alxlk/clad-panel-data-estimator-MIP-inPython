# Monte carlo simulation

Simulated data can be found in the archive simulation_data.zip. It includes 4 different simulated datasets based on the data generating processes described in the paper "Galvao, A. F., Lamarche, C., & Lima, L. R. (2013). Estimation of censored quantile regression for panel data with fixed effects. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 108(503), 1075-1089."

A python script main_panel_montecarlo.py that runs the MIP estimator is provided. Saved runs of the MIP estimators are also provided.

Python script for a monte carlo simulation and results are provided.
